# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## What this Module Challenge was About: 
In this challenge we put the HTML and CSS skills we've learned so far by editing code for a hypothetical company's webpage. This was an important challenge as it is something we could realistically be hired for after leaving the bootcamp. I found myself challenged by methods of liking the semantic changes I made to the HTML file with the pre-existing CSS parameters. Overall it was fun and engaging.
